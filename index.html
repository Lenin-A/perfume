            About Us
        </h1>
        <p>Perfume, a delightful blend of concentrated fragrance and alcohol, is more than just a pleasant scent. It's an invisible accessory, a mood elevator, and a memory maker. Perfumes come in a vast array, categorized by scent families like floral, oriental, or citrusy. Each fragrance is a complex creation, with top notes (the initial light impression), heart notes (the main body of the scent), and base notes (the lingering aroma).Perfume selection is a personal journey. Some prefer fresh, light florals like rose or jasmine, while others gravitate towards warm, spicy orientals with notes of amber or vanilla. The right perfume can boost confidence, evoke emotions, and even trigger memories.</p>
